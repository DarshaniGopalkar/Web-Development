Task 5 focuses on creating a clean and accessible contact form using only HTML and CSS, 
where input validation is handled by built-in HTML5 features without using JavaScript. 
The task involves using form elements like <form>, <input>, <textarea>, and <button>, applying appropriate input types such as email and telephone, 
and using validation attributes like required, pattern, and maxlength to ensure correct user input. Labels are properly linked to inputs for accessibility, 
form fields are logically grouped, and CSS is used to design a user-friendly interface. 
The form is tested directly in the browser to observe default validation messages, ensuring a fully validated and professional contact form
