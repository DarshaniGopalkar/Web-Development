Semantic Tags


🔹 <header>

Contains intro content + navigation

Helps screen readers understand page structure

🔹 <nav>

Used only for navigation links

Improves accessibility & SEO

🔹 <main>

Wraps the main content

There should be only one <main> per page

🔹 <section>

Groups related content

Used instead of random <div>s

🔹 <article>

Used for independent content (education block)

🔹 <footer>

Contains contact info, copyright

Clearly separates page ending content

👉 Why not <div>?
Because <div> has no meaning, semantic tags give context + accessibility.
